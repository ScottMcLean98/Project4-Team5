# Project4-Team5
Final Project: Predicting no-shows at medical appointments

The goal of the project is to use machine learning to correctly predict if a patient is going to show up to their appointment or not.

Source for the data is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments?select=KaggleV2-May-2016.csv (Renamed no_show_data.csv and placed in the Resources file)

Goal One 

As a group make a model from all the data except the PatientId, AppointmentID, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, and Neighbourhood that correctly predicts the outcome of whether a patient shows up to an appointment or not. 
Goal Two 

See if any of the individual issues is a good single-issue predictor of a no-show appointment and create visualizations to show the results. Create models without the single-issue to see how it changes the accuracy of the model from goal one.
